# LunarVault – Lua File Dropper Builder (Auto .EXE Compiler)  

**LunarVault** is a lightweight and powerful **Lua-based dropper builder** that takes any URL as input and generates a self-contained `.exe` file. The resulting executable will download and execute the specified file when run.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Fully Automated** – Input a URL, and LunarVault generates a working dropper `.exe`.  
✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – No unnecessary dependencies, just pure Lua.  
✅ **Customizable** – Modify the generated script before compilation if needed.  
✅ **Cross-Compatible** – Runs on Windows without requiring Lua installed.  
✅ **Stealthy Execution** – Minimal footprint and efficient execution.  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Provide a URL** – Enter the URL of the file to be downloaded and executed.  
2. **Build the Dropper** – LunarVault generates a Lua script and compiles it into an `.exe`.  
3. **Run the Executable** – The generated `.exe` downloads and runs the file automatically.
